**1. Introduction & Overview**

*   **1.1. Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for "ReadLater Pro," a browser extension designed to help users save online articles, track their reading progress, and manage their reading list effectively.
*   **1.2. Problem Statement:** Users often save interesting articles or web pages with the intention of reading them later but struggle to manage these saved items, frequently losing track of what they wanted to read or where they stopped reading within an article. Existing solutions may be overly complex or lack robust progress tracking.
*   **1.3. Vision / High-Level Solution:** To provide a seamless and user-friendly browser extension that allows users to save articles with one click, automatically syncs saved items and reading progress across devices, accurately remembers the user's scroll position within saved articles, provides organizational tools, and offers basic annotation features (highlights/notes). This aims to create a focused and efficient "read later" experience.

**2. Goals & Objectives**

*   **2.1. Business Goals:**
    *   Develop a production-ready, reliable, and maintainable browser extension.
    *   Provide a compelling alternative to existing "read later" services.
*   **2.2. Product Goals:**
    *   Deliver a seamless one-click article saving experience.
    *   Implement accurate and persistent scroll position tracking for saved articles.
    *   Provide intuitive reading list management (tags, search, sorting).
    *   Enable basic highlighting and note-taking on saved articles.
    *   Ensure user data (list, progress, notes) is securely stored and synced across devices via user accounts.
    *   Achieve high user satisfaction through a clean, efficient UI and reliable functionality.
*   **2.3. Success Metrics (KPIs):**
    *   Number of active users.
    *   Average number of articles saved per user.
    *   Feature adoption rate (progress tracking, notes).
    *   User retention rate.
    *   Browser store ratings and reviews.

**3. Scope**

*   **3.1. In Scope:**
    *   Browser Extension (Manifest V3 for Chrome initially, potential for Firefox/Edge considered).
    *   User Authentication & Authorization using Clerk.
    *   One-click saving of article URLs and fetching core article content/metadata.
    *   Backend service for data persistence and synchronization.
    *   Cloud database storage (MongoDB).
    *   Reading list view (dedicated page or popup) with management features:
        *   Display saved articles (Title, Source, Date Saved, Est. Reading Time, Progress).
        *   Tagging/Labeling articles.
        *   Searching articles by title, content (if stored), or tags.
        *   Sorting articles (Date Saved, Reading Time, Progress).
        *   Deleting articles.
    *   Automatic scroll position tracking and saving (syncs via backend).
    *   Calculation and display of estimated reading time.
    *   Basic text highlighting feature on saved article content (within a reader view if implemented, or potentially on the original page if feasible).
    *   Basic note-taking feature associated with articles or highlights.
    *   Data synchronization across logged-in sessions/browsers.
*   **3.2. Out of Scope (for this version):**
    *   Mobile application (iOS/Android).
    *   Advanced AI features (e.g., summarization, topic extraction).
    *   Social sharing features.
    *   Collaborative features (sharing lists/articles).
    *   Offline-first mode requiring extensive local caching beyond basic state.
    *   Public API.
    *   Advanced analytics dashboards for users.

**4. User Personas & Scenarios**

*   **4.1. Primary Persona(s):**
    *   **Alex (Busy Professional):** Reads industry news and research papers online. Often finds articles during work but needs to save them for later (commute, evening). Needs a quick way to save and easily resume reading across laptop and home computer. Values efficiency and minimal distraction.
    *   **Sam (Student/Researcher):** Saves numerous academic articles, blog posts, and resources for study. Needs to organize saved items by topic/course (tags) and potentially add quick notes or highlights. Needs reliable progress tracking for long documents.
*   **4.2. Key User Scenarios / Use Cases:**
    *   **Saving an Article:** User finds an interesting article -> Clicks the extension icon -> Article is saved to their list with metadata fetched -> Confirmation shown.
    *   **Accessing Reading List:** User clicks extension icon -> Selects "View Full List" -> A new tab opens displaying all saved articles.
    *   **Organizing List:** User views their list -> Adds tags ("Work", "Research") to articles -> Searches for articles tagged "Research".
    *   **Resuming Reading:** User opens a saved article from their list -> The page scrolls automatically to the last saved position.
    *   **Making Notes:** User is reading a saved article -> Selects text -> Clicks a highlight button -> Adds a text note associated with the highlight.
    *   **Using on a New Device:** User installs extension on a new computer -> Logs in using Clerk -> Entire reading list, progress, and notes are available.

    *   **NFR2.2:** Database queries should remain efficient as data volume increases (use appropriate indexing).
*   **7.3. Usability:**
    *   **NFR3.1:** The user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate.
    *   **NFR3.2:** Core actions (save, view list, resume reading) must be easily discoverable and require minimal clicks.
    *   **NFR3.3:** Feedback must be provided for user actions (e.g., confirmation on save, loading indicators).
*   **7.4. Reliability / Availability:**
    *   **NFR4.1:** The service (backend, database) should aim for high availability (e.g., >99.9% uptime).
    *   **NFR4.2:** Data synchronization should be reliable; data loss must be minimized.

    *   **NFR5.4:** Database access must be properly secured.
    *   **NFR5.5:** Extension permissions must be minimized to only what is necessary (activeTab, storage, potentially scripting for progress tracking/highlighting).
*   **7.6. Accessibility:**
    *   **NFR6.1:** The extension UI should follow basic accessibility guidelines (WCAG A/AA) including keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and ARIA attributes where appropriate.
*   **7.7. Maintainability:**

**Note to the AI Code Assistant:**

*   Please ensure the implementation adheres strictly to the requirements outlined in this PRD.
*   The goal is a **production-ready** solution, not an MVP. This includes robust error handling, security best practices, and comprehensive functionality as described.
*   Use the specified technical stack: Browser Extension (Manifest V3, HTML/CSS/JS), Backend (Node.js recommended, potentially using Serverless Functions), MongoDB database, and Clerk for authentication.
*   Follow the specified project structure (`extension/`, `backend/`).
*   Ensure the code is well-documented, follows industry best practices (e.g., linting, clear variable names, modular design), and is easily maintainable.
*   Implement sufficient testing (unit, integration) to guarantee functionality.
*   The frontend (`extension/` code) must be thoroughly tested and confirmed to be free of console errors during standard operation.
*   Pay close attention to Non-Functional Requirements, especially Security, Performance, and Reliability.
